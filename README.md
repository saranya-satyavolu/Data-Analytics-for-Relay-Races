Data Analysis ( Analysis of Relay Races in international athletics competitions)

Data analysis comprises of various phases and each phase is required to eliminate redundancies and to achieve accuracy in predictions to be taken.
As observed there are four phases for data analysis including the data extraction phase,refining phase,exploration and drawing conclusions phase.This project includes the work done in each and every phase for this project.

Installations required:
Python 2.7 or higher versions
Jupyter Notebook
MS-Excel 
Web Extractor

Key features used:
1) Eliminating unnecessary or invalid data 
2) Analysis for identifying weightage of features
3) Algorithms for making predictions

Files and their descriptions:

data - excel sheets and output for various statistical techniques to analyse
data visualization - plots to visualize patterns and data
course.py - segregating the winning teams
describeleg.py - statistics for each position in the relay
histogramconstruct.py - Plotting histograms to visualize the time taken by athletes at each position
patternsfreq.py - Finding the frequency of each pattern ( regularity in the data)
sk.py - To output the confusion matrices
